Focal points can be set in the theme editor `image_picker` setting, or from the Files page.\n\nTo make sure that your theme respects the focal point of the image, do the following:\n\n- Render your images using the [image_tag](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/filters/image_tag) filter.\n- Consider positioning images within containers using `object-fit: cover`.\n\nUsing `image_tag`, if a focal point was provided, then an `object-position` style is added to the image tag, with the value set to the focal point.\n\n**Input**\n\n```liquid\n\n{{ section.settings.image_with_text_image | image_url: width: 1500 | image_tag }}\n\n```\n\n**Output**\n\n```html\n\n<img src=\"octopus-tentacle.jpg?v=1&width=1500\" alt=\"My alt text\"\n srcset=\"octopus-tentacle.jpg?v=1&width=352 352w,\n         octopus-tentacle.jpg?v=1&width=832 832w,\n         octopus-tentacle.jpg?v=1&width=1200 1200w\"\n width=\"1500\" height=\"1875\"\n style=\"object-position:25% 10%;\">\n\n\n```\n\nIf you need override the `object-position` style for a specific use case, then pass a style: `object-position: inherit;` property to the `image_tag` filter.\n\n> **TIP**\n>\n> You can also access the focal point data using [image.presentation.focal_point](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/objects/image_presentation#image_presentation-focal_point).\n\n#\n\n---\n\n[Shopify Documentation](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings#image_picker)\n","body":{"type":"image_picker","id":"$1","label":"${1/([^_]+)(_*)/${1:/capitalize}${2:+ }/g}$2","info":"$3"}},{"label":"Inline RichText","markdownDescription":"A setting of type `inline_richtext` outputs HTML markup that isn't wrapped in paragraph tags (`<p>`).
