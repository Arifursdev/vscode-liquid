# v4.0.0 ~ vscode-liquid

This version ships with **breaking changes** and requires that you to align with new configuration. This is an important update as it will be the last **major** version release wherein users will need to undertake and apply changes to core configurations in preparation for the Liquify supersede. The next **major** release of the extension will be [Liquify](https://github.com/panoply/liquify) which means all future features will up-streamed to that project.

### See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/panoply/c371a90df35171f341b6cc5d7dccc312) for the quick-fix upgrade guide.

# Breaking Changes

Workspace and `.liquidrc` file settings now use a **new** definition structure for formatting configuration. There is no backwards compatibility, so you can either update to **4.0.0** or continue using **3.2.2**. Below is the **breaking changes** that ship in this release.

> **TLDR**
>
> No problems fam, see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/panoply/c371a90df35171f341b6cc5d7dccc312).

### Changed Rule Definitions

The new configurations are expressed using different structures. Depending on how you define settings, be it within a `.liquidrc` file or from within a `.vscode/settings.json` file the way to provide beautification rules has changed. See the below examples of the new configuration structures:

### Updating a `.liquidrc` File

For developers who leverage a `.liquidrc` file for beautification rules, the new structure requires you to nest rules under a `format` key property.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="500px"> OLD CONFIGURATION </th>
  <th width="500px">NEW CONFIGURATION  </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>

```jsonc
{
  //  "liquid.format.wrap": 0,
  //  "liquid.format.crlf": false,
  //  "liquid.format.endNewLine": false,
  //  "liquid.format.indentSize": 2,
  //  "liquid.format.preserveLine": 3,
  //  "liquid.format.commentIndent": false,
  //  "liquid.format.preserveComment": false,
  //  "liquid.format.markup": {},
  //  "liquid.format.script": {},
  //  "liquid.format.style": {},
  //  "liquid.format.json": {},
}
```

</td>

<td>

```jsonc
{
  "format": {
    "ignore": [],
    "wrap": 0,
    "wrapFraction": 0,
    "crlf": false,
    "endNewline": false,
    "indentSize": 2,
    "preserveLine": 3,
    "liquid": {}, // New! Liquid specific format rules
    "markup": {},
    "json": {},
    "style": {},
    "script": {}
  }
}
```

</td>

</tr>
</body>
</table>

### Updating Workspace Settings

For developers who use workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) for defining beautification options. You will need to move configuration to the `liquid.format.rules` object.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="500px"> OLD CONFIGURATION </th>
  <th width="500px">NEW CONFIGURATION  </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>

```jsonc
{
  // "liquid.format.wrap": 0,
  // "liquid.format.crlf": false,
  // "liquid.format.endNewLine": false,
  // "liquid.format.indentSize": 2,
  // "liquid.format.preserveLine": 3,
  // "liquid.format.commentIndent": false,
  // "liquid.format.preserveComment": false,
  // "liquid.format.markup": {},
  // "liquid.format.script": {},
  // "liquid.format.style": {},
  // "liquid.format.json": {},
}
```

</td>

<td>

```jsonc
{
  "liquid.format.rules": {
    "ignore": [],
    "wrap": 0,
    "wrapFraction": 0,
    "crlf": false,
    "endNewline": false,
    "indentSize": 2,
    "preserveLine": 3,
    "liquid": {},
    "markup": {},
    "json": {},
    "style": {},
    "script": {}
  }
}
```

</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Deprecated the `liquid.settings.target` workspace option

The `liquid.settings.target` option is deprecated and no longer supported. Editor settings will default to the workspace `.vscode/settings.json` file and if one is not present in the project then the global (User Settings JSON) file will be used.

### Deprecated the `package.json` prettify config option

In version **v3.0.0** an additional configuration method was made available which allowed you to define formatting rules in a `package.json` file using a `prettify` property. As of version **4.0.0** this is no longer supported (nor is Prettify, see [Æsthetic replaced Prettify](#æsthetic-replaced-prettify)).

Option definitions using package.json files will return in Liquify, but under a different field value.

### Deprecated the `liquid.format.enable` workspace option

As per https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid/issues/132 the `liquid.format.enable` setting is no longer supported. To enable formatting on save within Liquid files, you will need provide **Language Specific** settings in either your user or workspace settings. Below is the how you enable formatting in **v4.0.0**:

```jsonc
{
  "[liquid]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "sissel.shopify-liquid"
  }
}
```

# New! File Associated Completions

Users have even more essential features available when choosing this extension for Shopify theme development or projects using Liquid. Support for file associated completions are now available. The `files` option is available to both the `.liquidrc` or workspace `.vscode/settings.json` settings. The option can used to provide file path references to project associated files. When you provide references then completion support is made available for the definition applied.

### Locale Completion Support

This release provides locale completion support. This is achieved by providing a project relative path to the default locale file used by your theme. When defined, the extension will provide locale completions in translation object token expressions. Locale completions will be triggered in when a quotation character is detected following output token delimiters, eg: `{{ ' }}` or `{{ " }}`. In addition, the `| t ` filter will be inserted automatically when none is detected.

### Settings Completion Support

This release provides `settings_schema.json` completion support. This is achieved by providing a project relative path to the location of your `settings_data.json` file used by your theme. When defined, the extension will provide completions on the `settings.*` object in Liquid tag and output tokens.

### Snippet Completion Support

This release provides snippet file completion support. This is achieved by defining project relative path/s to directories that contain snippets or alternatively you can provide globs matches. Snippets will be shown for in `{% render '' %}` tag and will also allow you to quick open files.

# Æsthetic replaced Prettify

The Prettify project is now shipped under under the module name **Æsthetic**. Æsthetic replaces Prettify as the core beautification tool used by the extension. Æsthetic is now under an RC version release along with exhausting tests and new features. Test cases against 100+ different code sample structures has brought Æsthetic to a far safer and more controlled level wherein code output respects input intent and changes will take the least most augmentative approach possible to prevent formats happening in unpredictable ways.

Æsthetic provides new beautification rules that expose more fine grained control over how your code is to be beautified. Your `.liquidrc` file will complain about now deprecated or changed rules. You should consult the [Æsthetic Documentation](https://æsthetic.dev) to familiarize yourself with the tool and better understand how each rule will effect code output.

Below are some key features of Æsthetic and what is being shipped in **4.0.0**.

### New! Language Specifics

Æsthetic has made previous global level rules available on a per-language basis. This means that you are able to use these rules in all supported lexer (liquid, markup, style and script) modes.

- `commentIndent`
- `commentNewline`
- `preserveComment`

### New! Liquid Specific Lexer

Liquid beautification rules are no longer coupled together with `markup` and instead can now be defined via a `liquid` property. This new structure decouples and separates Liquid from markup allowing for more concise control for Liquid specific beautification. There are also several new highly refined formatting options available for Liquid specific beautification.

### New! Liquid Rule: `ignoreTagList[]`

This is a `liquid` specific rule which accepts a list of tag names to excluded from formatting.

# New! Schema Snippets

In version **3.2.0** the extension introduced `{% schema %}` tag completion and validation support. This release improves upon this essential feature now `{% schema %}` JSON supports snippet completion capabilities.

# Snippets and Tabstops

Schema JSON provided snippet completion which can be invoked with `CRTL`+`SPACE`. All section structures are available, with additional ENBF tab-stop support which converts `id` defined values to Upcase format Labels.

### Full IETF local support

This release now supports all IETF locale completion structures for labels and other translation based properties.

### Detailed and informative descriptions

Schema JSON code regions now provide detailed documentation reference in hover and completion descriptions This information is extracted directly from the Shopify documentation.
