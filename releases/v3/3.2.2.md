# v3.2.2 ~ vscode-liquid

Some additional refinements following **3.2.0** minor version release and the subsequent patch **3.2.1**. This version fixes #135.

### Changes

Despite being a patch version release, it is important to note that Tag snippets no longer provide trim conditionals, you should instead rely on the formatting rule `delimiterTrims` for controlling this aspect. Some additional tags snippets were provided as an added bonus.

### Improvements

Schema tag blocks now support for locale based [IETF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) completions for the specified properties such as labels, info etc. It is important to note that not _all_ locale IEFT names are supported, only a few (for now) but this will be improved in later versions.
